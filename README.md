A simple e-commerce web application made with Html, CSS and JavaScript as Internship project with CodeBits Uganda Ltd

This project was intended to test my skills in Html, CSS and JavaScript after giving us 3 weeks to practice those 3 languanges using different resources.

# Assignment Details
Web Development Track

Introduction

The purpose of this track is to get students acquainted with web development technologies. The track will offer an Introduction to web development and will make no assumption of prior experience in the field.

Learn CSS from the ground up using this link <a href="https://web.dev/learn/css/" target="_blank">here.</a>
Learn javascript from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/" target="_blank">here.</a>


Assignments
The Students will be expected to go through all the material provided in the resources section in its exact order. Also, students will use this tutorial on CSS, which has the 4 core modules of CSS to understand styling HTML. Completion of this class will necessitate finishing a project which will be a simple e-commerce website selling Fashion items. Students will be expected to exhibit a lot of research as some of the things not covered in the course will add bonus points to the Final project.

Timeline
This iteration will run from 1st November to 29th. These 4 weeks can roughly be distribute as 1 for each of HTML, CSS, JS and then 1 week to finalise your selected project.

Projects
For your evaluation projects, you will be expected to pick from this list of projects that can be found in the UI image list here. This project is expected to be done in groups of two. The images represent the expected final User Interface. The students are expected to implement the user interface in code. Marking points will go on creativity and use of semantic tags. Mobile responsiveness will be awarded extra points.
Not more than 2 interns can choose one project so once we have put up the projects, coordinate project selection with @isaacmubiru99@gmail.com 

# Results
Throughout the four weeks of implementing this project, i have personally learnt a lot of concepts and got remainded of those that i had already encountered before, it has been a good experience and it has really really improved my coding skills expecially in Javascript where critical thinking ia required to bring out the concepts needed in their intended order.

# Conclusions
I would like to thank Mr. Ssejemba Daniel for assigning us such a project with a lot of core features  that we are going to apply in other projects and also Mr. Mubiru Isaac for always guiding us whenever we get stuck. 
Finally, I want to thank the management of CodeBits Uganda Limited for the opportunity they have given us.
